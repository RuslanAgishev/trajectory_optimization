# Frontier Exploration

## Installation

Clone the package and dependencies to ROS workspace:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/RuslanAgishev/frontier_exploration.git
git clone https://github.com/ros/geometry2
git clone https://github.com/ros/geometry
git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv
```
Setup python3 environment (called `dl` in this example) for the package with
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):
```
conda create -n dl
conda activate dl
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/frontier_exploration/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Follow [pytorch3d](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
installation instructions.

Build the ROS package (tested with Ubuntu 18.04):
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin config -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$HOME/miniconda3/envs/dl/bin/python3  \
              -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/miniconda3/envs/dl/include/python3.6m \
              -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$HOME/miniconda3/envs/dl/lib/libpython3.6m.so
catkin build frontier_exploration
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## Running

### Point cloud Visibility Estimation

<img src="./demos/hpr.gif">

Ones the package is installed, run the launch file and specify the bag file location:
```bash
roslaunch frontier_exploration pointcloud_processor.launch
rosbag play PATH_TO_BAG_FILE -r 5 --clock
```
Replace `PATH_TO_BAG_FILE` with the path to the bag file, for example: `./data/josef_2019-06-06-13-58-12_proc_0.1m.bag`

In this example, the purple points are the whole cloud in a camera frame,
grey ones are only the visible points (not occluded by other points from the camera perspective).
The hidden points removal (HPR) algorithm implementation is based on the article
[Katz et al](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/ronen/sites/math.ronen/files/uploads/katz_tal_basri_-_direct_visibility_of_point_sets.pdf
).
The resultant point cloud rendering on an image plane is done with
[pytorch3d](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d) library.

### Multiple cameras:

<img src="./demos/hpr_cams_01234.gif">

In this example, the point cloud visibility is estimated for each individual camera
(in its field of view and the distance range) separately.
The combined point cloud is then visualized in the robot `base_link` frame.

### Camera Position Optimization

<img src="./demos/cam_pose_opt.gif">

Ego-pose optimization based on the observed in camera frustum point cloud visibility estimation.
In this example, the points color encodes a distance-based (to camera frame) reward.
The white points are currently observed ones by camera.

```bash
roslaunch frontier_exploration cam_position_opt.launch
```

### Camera Trajectory Evaluation

<img src="./demos/cam_traj_eval.gif">

A camera trajectory could be evaluated by a number of observed voxels (points in the cloud).
Single pose visibility estimation rewards are combined using log odds representation as it
is done in [OctoMap](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235008236_OctoMap_A_Probabilistic_Flexible_and_Compact_3D_Map_Representation_for_Robotic_Systems) paper.

### Camera Trajectory Optimization

<img src="./demos/cam_traj_opt.gif">

Camera pose (X, Y and Yaw) optimization is applied here for each separate sampled way-point
of an initial trajectory.

```bash
roslaunch frontier_exploration cam_traj_opt.launch
```
